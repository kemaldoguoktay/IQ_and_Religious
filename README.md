# üåç Religion and IQ: An Analytical Exploration

Welcome to my project where I delve into the relationship between **IQ** and **Religion** on a country-by-country basis. This project utilizes various data visualization techniques to uncover potential patterns and insights between these two complex variables.

---

## üìå Goal
The primary goal of this analysis is to explore how **IQ levels** and **religious affiliations** of populations correlate across different countries. Through thorough data analysis and multiple visualizations, we aim to answer thought-provoking questions about intelligence and belief systems.

---

## üõ† Software & Tools
This project is implemented using **Python** and a set of powerful data analysis libraries. 

### Key Libraries:
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preparation.
- **Seaborn**: For creating aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and custom visualizations.
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping to collect data.
- **Tabulate**: For neatly formatted data display in tables.

## üîç Analytical Breakdown
### 1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scraped IQ data and religion distribution for each country using **Beautiful Soup**.
   
### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and merged datasets.
   
### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the distributions of IQ scores and religious affiliations across countries.
   - Explored correlations between IQ and dominant religions.

### 4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created comprehensive plots to understand the relationship between **IQ** and **religion** using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
   - Used **bar charts** and **scatter plots** to visualize trends.

### 5. **Key Insights**:
   - Discovered potential correlations between the dominant religions of countries and their average IQ scores.
   - Explored whether regions with higher religious adherence exhibit specific trends in IQ.
